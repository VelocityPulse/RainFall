We can see a binary called level0 in the home.

After an execution of it, we can see a segfault (core dumped)
./level0
-> segfault

./level0 a
./level0 a a a
-> Prints "No !"

After have been a GDB on this level0, we can see than in the 
first instructions there's a atoi.
Probably the reason of the segfault.
We can also see than the next line is comparing the result of the
atoi, with 0x1A7 (423).

After have tried : ./level0 423 
We can see than a sh has been executed.
It's after that we tried to navigate to level1 and read the .pass
Which works. 

.pass1 :
