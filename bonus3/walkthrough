The last bonus takes a single argument (will exit if argc != 2)

It fopens "/home/user/end/.pass", freads the first 66 bytes and adds a '\0' at the end
argv[1] is passed as a parameter for a call to atoi().
The returned value is used as an offset to the read string to set it to 0
The program then compares argv[1] and the read string.
If both are identical, a shell is opened.

As it turns out there is one simple way to have two equal strings
for the strcmp() call.

If you input "" into argv[1], a null-terminated empty string will be input.
This will cause atoi to return 0, thus set 0 to the first character of the fread string.
As a result, strcmp will compare two null-terminated empty strings and open the gates.
